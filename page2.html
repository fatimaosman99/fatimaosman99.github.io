    <p>Godamn, man child
        You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
        You're fun and you're wild
        But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
        Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
        But I can't change that and I can't change your mood
        Ah-ah, oh
        'Cause you're just a man
        It's just what you do
        Your head in your hands
        As you color me blue
        Yeah, you're just a man
        All through and through
        Your head in your hands
        As you color me blue
        Blue, blue, blue
        Goddamn, man child
        You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
        Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Can-you-know-it-all
        You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
        But I don't get bored, I just see it through
        Why wait for the best when I could have you?
        You
        'Cause you're just a man
        It's just what you do
        Your head in your hands
        As you color me blue
        Yeah, you're just a man
        All through and through
        Your head in your hands
        As you color me blue
        Blue, blue
        You make me blue
        Blue, blue 
        Blue, blue, blue, blue</p>
