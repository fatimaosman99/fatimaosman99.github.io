    <p>Summertime, and the livin's easy
        Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
        All the people in the dance will agree
        That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
        Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
        And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
        Me and my girl, we got this relationship
        I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
        On lockdown, like a penitentiary
        She spreads her lovin' all over
        And when she gets home, there's none left for me
        Summertime, and the livin's easy
        Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
        All the people in the dance will agree
        That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
        Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
        And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
        (Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)
        Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
        My burning sun will, some day, rise
        So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
        Said, I'm gonna play with myself
        Show them, now, we've come off the shelf
        Summertime, and the livin's easy
        Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
        All the people in the dance will agree
        That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
        Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
        And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
        (Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)
        Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
        Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
        The tension, it's getting hotter
        I'd like to hold her head underwater
        (Summertime)
        (Ah, ah, ah)
        Summertime, and the livin's easy
        Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
        All the people in the dance will agree
        That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
        Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
        And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder</p>
